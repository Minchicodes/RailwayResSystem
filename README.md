# RailwayResSystem
Created a railway reservation system as part of one of my school projects-
Designed and implemented an SQL database using SQLite to manage data such as train information, routes, booking details, and passenger records.
Developed a front-end application using React for the UI and built a server application with Node.js and Express to create APIs for seamless front-end and back-end integration.
